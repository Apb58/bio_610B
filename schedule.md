# Course schedule

The tentative schedule (subject to adjustment, especially towards the end) is
(**K** referes to Kruschke):

Week 1 (*1/9*)

: [(slides)](slides/week_1.slides.html) Recap of probability and likelihood;
    central limit theorem ($\sqrt{n}$);
    Bayes' rule.
    The beta-binomial distribution: putting a prior on the probability of success.
    **(K ch. 4, 5, 6)**

    - **Short report:** (due 1/16) [MLE for beta-binomial](hws/week_1.html)
    - **Demo:** (from 1/11) [Beta-binomial analysis](demos/beta_binom.html)

Week 2 (*1/16*)

: [(slides)](slides/week_2.slides.html) Introduction to MCMC and Stan for sampling from posterior distributions,
    hierarchical models for binary responses, shrinkage.
    **(K ch. 7, 9 and Intro to Stan)** 


Week 3 (*1/23*)

: Assessing power, model choice, and using simulation: looking more at shrinkage,
    posterior predictive sampling, Bayes factors.
    Logistic regression: robustly, including categorical factors.
    **(K ch 13 and 21, with a bit of chapters 10-12)**


Week 4 (*1/30*)

: Count data: using Poisson regression and hierarchical modeling
    to fit overdispersion.  Model selection by crossvalidation.
    **(K ch 24)**


Week 5 (*2/6*)

: Continuous ("metric") data: groupwise means, univariate regression, robust regression
    by adjusting the noise distribution, multivariate regression and variable selection; the Horseshoe.
    **(K ch 16, 17, 18)**


Week 6 (*2/13*)

: Friends of ANOVA: sources of variance.  An in-depth applied example, cumulative.
    **(K ch 19, 20)**

Week 7 *(2/20)*

: Dimension reduction: overview of the goal and taxonomy of various approaches (PCA, CCA, t-sne, etc).
    Deconvolution. Regularization as a penalty and as a (Bayesian) prior.
    **(Reference to Quinn & Keough)**

Week 8 *(2/27)*

: Clustering and categorization: softmax regression; applied example.
   **(K ch 22)** 

Week 9 *(3/6)*

: Time series: modeling local dependency, smoothing. Conditional independence.


Week 10 *(3/13)*

: Spatial and network covariance: sharing power between related locations.
